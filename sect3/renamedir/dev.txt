2. he loops interviews are not expected to be in order, it was for me :
1) Data Structures:
We talked about the time and space complexity for multiple DS and how is hash accessed by the compiler in Java
and I had a leetcode question I guess medium
2) Programming:
This was a little bit hard, Asked about concurrency,deadlocks mainly and some DS and another medium question for the closest target
3) System Design
The interviewer was nice here and we had a discussion for 1 hour about how to implement a monitoring system including High availability and Distrubted system architecture
4) General Knowledge:
Many questions about concurrency, threads, networks like communication protocols, security, database multithreading
