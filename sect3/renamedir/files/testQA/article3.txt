Man Utd's latest setback involving VAR threatened to derail them as Burnley grew in confidence. However, Evans stepped up with a moment of magic to assist Fernandes for a superb volley just before half-time. It was the 35-year-old defender's first league assist for United since February 2013, when he set up Wayne Rooney.

Hojlund was a whisker away from converting Diogo Dalot's drilled cross after the restart and came close again when set up by Rashford's header 10 minutes later. Burnley, though, were subdued in the second half as they struggled to respond to going a goal behind.

Man Utd risked inviting more pressure from the hosts as they failed to hold onto the ball in the second period but Burnley were unable to capitalise. Luca Koleosho, Burnley's 19-year-old winger, was their brightest spark but when he was taken off with 15 minutes to go the home side lost much of their threat.
