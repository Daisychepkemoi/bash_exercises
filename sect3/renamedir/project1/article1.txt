Mejbri, 20, was heavily linked with a move away in the summer transfer window but decided to stay and fight for a first-team place following talks with Ten Hag. The Tunisia international made a big impression in last weekend's 3-1 defeat against Brighton by scoring after being introduced from the bench and was rewarded with a start against Burnley.

With injuries now beginning to bite, Ten Hag deployed Mejbri as a No.10 for the 1-0 win at Turf Moor, which came courtesy of a phenomenal volley from Bruno Fernandes. And the Dutchman was impressed with what he saw from the former Monaco youngster.

Speaking after the match, Ten Hag told TNT Sports: “Of course it’s a concern. You have so many injuries, you have a problem in the routine of your game.
