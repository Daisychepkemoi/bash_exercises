eguilon, who said 'I know I can contribute to Manchester United' when he signed, emerged with credit in the 3-1 defeat against Brighton and he impressed again in appearances versus Bayern Munich and Burnley.

The left-back is capable going forward and he's been defensively solid. He's slowly becoming a fan favourite and playing despite having been unwell against Burnley only enhanced his reputation on the terraces.

United fans will continue to fall for him if he can sustain his performances while Shaw is injured.
