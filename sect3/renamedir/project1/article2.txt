Ten Hag billed this as a must-win game for Man Utd after a run of three disappointing defeats. There were signs of a response from his side as they nicked possession off Burnley in their own half on a few occasions early on. Fernandes stung the paws of Trafford as Marcus Rashford found the side-netting.



Burnley were unperturbed by their early mistakes as they took control of the game. Under-fire goalkeeper Onana made amends for his howler in Munich with a diving stop from Amdouni's low header after 10 minutes. The Switzerland international hit the post six minutes later to turn the heat up on a nervous United side.
